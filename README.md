# Learning Confidence - A Python Library

This Python library is built under the instruction of [How to create a Python library](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-create-a-python-library-7d5aea80cc3f).



## How to install the library

The library is a `.whl` file, which can be imported using `pip`. The file is under the `/dist` folder, and the current file name is `learning_conf-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`. 

To install the library, make a copy of the `.whl` file to a directory, and then start a terminal/shell and enter:

```
pip install ./learning_conf-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

## How to import and use the library

After the library has been installed, you can import the library in Python: 

```python
from learning_conf import *
```

There are two functions included in this library, `get_confidence()` and `plot_confidence()`. Both functions are tailored to use as my PhD project, so it may not be useful for other purposes.
